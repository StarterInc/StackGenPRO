## the Starter Ignite Plugins Folder

Put any YML or JSON Swagger/OpenAPI Spec files that you wish to automatically merge in the root of the plugins folder such as location services:

.../resoures/openapi_specs/plugins/location_services.yml

For plugins that are selected at runtime, put new or changed template spec files in the appropriate subfolder under ignite (built into the Ignite project) or vendors (3rd party.)
